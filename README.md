# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems that I solve daily. Each solution includes:

- The problem-solving approach
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Example usage with test cases

## Repository Structure

The problems are organized by difficulty level:
- `/Easy`: Solutions to easy difficulty problems
- `/Medium`: Solutions to medium difficulty problems
- `/Hard`: Solutions to hard difficulty problems

## Example Solutions

Each solution file includes example usage. For instance:

```python
# Example for Palindrome Number (Problem #9)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    solution = Solution()
    if solution.isPalindrome(x):
        print(f"{x} is a palindrome.")
    else:
        print(f"{x} is not a palindrome.")
```

## Updates

I post my newly solved LeetCode solutions daily, each with detailed explanations and example usage programs.
